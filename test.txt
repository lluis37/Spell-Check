This text includes several test cases that your spell-checking program needs to handle correctly.

1. Trailing punctuation:
Let's see if it can handle periods, commas, question marks, exclamation marks, and semicolons correctly; also, brackets (like these), quotes "like these", and 'these'!

2. Hyphens:
A well-known spell-checker should handle mid-day, spell-check, and mother-in-law as correct, assuming mid, day, spell, check, mother, and law are in the dictionary.
It should also handle not-splled-corektly, BaDDDDDDD-spelling, and macDonald-chck as incorrect spelling, assuming not, spelled, correctly, bad, spelling, MacDonald, and check are in the dictionary.

3. Capitalization:
hello, Hello, HELLO should all be accepted if "hello" is in the dictionary.
However, HeLlO should be flagged as incorrect.

Additionally, MacDonald should be accepted if "MacDonald" is in the dictionary. MACDONALD should also be correct, but Macdonald and macdonald should not, assuming the dictionary respects the specified capitalization.

End of tests.
